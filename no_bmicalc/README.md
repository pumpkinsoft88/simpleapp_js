# BMI_calculator is my first application of HTML5, CSS3 (with SCSS) and vanilla JS (haven't learned React yet).
It is supposed to be a simple interface where user enters weight and height and gets a Body Mass Index result shown on screen.
Still need to work on form validation and adding more functionalities to the app, though.

Things to do:
1. Make sure accessibility is okay;
2. Fix alert removal bug;
3. Add other metric units to the UI so user can decide what to use for input

That's it for now =)
